          devToolsService: ChromeDevToolsService(), // Enable Chrome DevTools Services
          viewportWidth: viewportSize.width - queryData.padding.horizontal, // Adjust the viewportWidth
          viewportHeight: viewportSize.height - queryData.padding.vertical, // Adjust the viewportHeight
          bundle: WebFBundle.fromUrl('https://andycall.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/demo/demo-vue.js'), // The page entry point

## How it works

WebF provide a rendering engine which follow the W3C standard like the browser does. It can render HTML/CSS and execute JavaScript. It's built on top of the flutter rendering pipelines and implements its' own layout and paint algorithms.

With WebF, Web Apps and Flutter Apps are sharing the rendering context. It means that you can use Flutter Widgets define your HTML elements and embedded your Web App as a Flutter Widget in your flutter apps.
